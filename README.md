# basic-calculator

This is a practice on logical operands. By the end of the project, I am to have a basic working calculator. It should be able to add, subtract, divide, and multiply any pair of numbers. It should work by storing the current number and waiting on the next input. There will also be a clear button that should function as a refresh.

On top of showcasing what I've learned with JS so far, this should also serve as a simple exercise in CSS and HTML manipulation. Each section of the calculator should be color coded and styled to look nice.
